# HadamardProduct.GenusOne

The genus-one Weierstrass factor `E₁(s/ρ) = (1 - s/ρ)·exp(s/ρ)` and its logarithmic
derivative, together with the small bridge lemmas relating this repository's
`logDerivativeResponse` to Mathlib's `logDeriv`. Identity content only — no sign or
zero-free claims.

## Main declarations

* `hadamardGenus1Factor`, `_ne_zero`, `_differentiableAt`, `_zero` — the factor and its
  basic analytic facts.
* `logDerivativeResponse_eq_logDeriv`, `logDerivativeResponse_mul_eq_add`,
  `deriv_div_eq_zero_of_logDerivativeResponse_eq` — `logDerivativeResponse` ↔ `logDeriv`.
* `logDeriv_hadamardGenus1Factor` — the classical `1/(s-ρ) + 1/ρ`.
