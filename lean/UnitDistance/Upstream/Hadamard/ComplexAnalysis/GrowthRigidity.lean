# Quantitative rigidity for entire functions

This module records two elementary but useful consequences of Cauchy's
estimates.  They are formulated as little-oh growth conditions at infinity,
without introducing an order-of-an-entire-function API.

* `differentiable_eq_const_of_sublinearNormGrowth` says that an entire
  function satisfying `‖f z‖ = o(‖z‖)` is constant.
* `differentiable_eq_affine_of_subquadraticNormGrowth` says that an entire
  function satisfying `‖f z‖ = o(‖z‖²)` is affine.

The proofs use Cauchy estimates on circles centered at an arbitrary point.
The radius is chosen large enough that every point of the circle lies in the
region where the asymptotic estimate applies.  This moving-center formulation
is particularly convenient for controlling the entire remainder in a
Hadamard or Mittag--Leffler logarithmic-derivative expansion.
