# Nevanlinna proximity bounds and pointwise logarithmic growth

This module avoids pointwise lower estimates for a denominator.  The First
Main Theorem bounds the proximity of a quotient represented codiscretely as
`f * g⁻¹` by the characteristics of `f` and `g`, up to an explicit constant.
Poisson's formula then turns the circle average of `log⁺ ‖q‖` into a
pointwise upper bound for the real part of any entire logarithm of `q`.
