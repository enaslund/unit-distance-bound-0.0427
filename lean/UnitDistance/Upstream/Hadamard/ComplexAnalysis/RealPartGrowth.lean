# From real-part growth to polynomial rigidity

Borel--Caratheodory converts a one-sided upper bound on the real part of an
entire function into a norm bound on a smaller disk.  Consequently, to prove
that an entire logarithm is affine it is enough to control its real part; one
does not need an a priori bound on its imaginary part or on a reciprocal
quotient.

The logarithmic formulation is particularly useful for a nowhere-zero entire
function `q`.  If `exp h = q`, then

`(h z).re = log ‖q z‖`.

Thus subquadratic upper growth of `log ‖q‖` forces every entire logarithm of
`q` to be affine.
