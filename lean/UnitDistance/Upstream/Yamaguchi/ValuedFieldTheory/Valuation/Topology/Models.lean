# Topological API for `WithTopology`

This file adds only the two topology lemmas used by valuation theory. The
underlying type, topology, and basic API come directly from Mathlib. Algebraic
structures needed on a particular topology-indexed copy are installed at that
copy's owner rather than globally in the root `WithTopology` namespace.
